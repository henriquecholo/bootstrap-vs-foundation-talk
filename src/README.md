## Right library for the project
  - Both structures are simmilary: Install using *bower*, run with *grunt*, use *SASS*, *JS* codes and more
  - LESS X SASS
   - Bootstrap uses LESS and now SASS is compatible. Foundation uses *only* SASS (advanced with Libsass)
  - *Mobile First VS Mobile Also*
   - Foundation was made to be built on Mobile First
   - Bootstrap was made to be built on Desktop and fit for mobile

----

## Right library for the project

  - *Old and Cross Browsers*
   - Bootstrap is compatible with more older browsers than Foundation
    - IE+8 Bootstrap x IE+9 Foundation
    - Opera only on Bootstrap
   - Foundation is compatible with more mobile browsers than Bootstrap
    - Android 2-4, Windows Phone 7+, Surface (tablets)
   - Both are compatible with *newest browsers*

----

## Right library for the project

  - Foundation uses *Rems* (percentage) x Bootstrap uses *Pixels*
  - UI Elements
   - Bootstrap has *more* UI elements than Foundation
  - Documentation
   - The CSS documentation are *simmilary* on both
   - The JS doc for Foundation contains *images explaining the feature* x Bootstrap does *not*
  - Community
   - Bootstrap has the *most popular community*

---

## Conclusion

- *Choose carefully* if you are going to use Frameworks
 - If so, you should check what you will really need for your project and which one is best for your purpose (Features, Community, Mobile)
- *Don't say that one is better then the other*
- They are competing each other to create excellent options for UI developer, even on performance
 - *It's a healthy war for us*
